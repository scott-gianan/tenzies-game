# About

Inspired by the dice game, **TENZI®** - a simple yet competitive game where the first player who rolls all 10 on the same number and yells “**TENZI**,” wins.

# How to play the game

Roll all of the tiles at once and identify the number you want to achieve for all the tile. Then re-roll all those that do not match your number. You have to continue doing this until all the tiles show the number.
